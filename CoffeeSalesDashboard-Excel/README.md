## Project Summary

I designed an interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard in Excel, utilizing INDEX MATCH and XLOOKUP (or alternatives) to clean and integrate data. Pivot Tables and Charts visualized sales trends, top customers, and country-wise sales. Slicers and time series enhanced usability, fostering hands-on learning. The project showcases my Excel skills for informed decision-making.
