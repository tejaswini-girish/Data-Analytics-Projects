# Data-Analytics-Projects
Exploring data and analysing it using different tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib...etc

## Project 1 : Sales Analysis

Cleaning our data...
1. Drop NaN values from DataFrame
2. Removing rows based on a condition
3. Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Questions:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?

How?
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs
