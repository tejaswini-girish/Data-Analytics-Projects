# Data-Analytics-Projects
Exploring data and analysing it using different tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib...etc

## Project 1 : Sales Analysis

Cleaning our data...
1. Drop NaN values from DataFrame
2. Removing rows based on a condition
3. Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Questions:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?

How?
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs

## Project 2 : FIFA Players Analysis

1. Cleaning and Tranforming Data using Pandas
2. Analyse
3. Visualise using Matplotlib

## Project 3 : Coffee Sales Analysis 

In my project "Coffee Sales Dashboard," I embarked on a journey to harness the power of Excel as a potent tool for data analysis and visualization. This project underscores my expertise in employing Excel's advanced functions and features to uncover meaningful insights from complex datasets.
